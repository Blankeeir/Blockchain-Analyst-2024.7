# Week 2: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

## Introduction and Background

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful cryptographic technique that enables computations on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first. This capability is crucial for maintaining data privacy and security, particularly in untrusted environments where sensitive data must be processed. FHE achieves "zero trust" by allowing encrypted data to remain secure, even during computation, thereby mitigating various security and privacy risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access.

### Repositories and Tools

1. **[Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL):** Microsoft SEAL is an open-source, easy-to-use homomorphic encryption library developed by the Cryptography and Privacy Research Group at Microsoft. It is widely used in research and applications that require data privacy and security through FHE.
2. **[Google FHE Compiler for C++](https://github.com/google/fully-homomorphic-encryption.git):** This repository contains open-source libraries and tools to perform FHE operations on encrypted datasets, specifically optimized for C++ environments. 

These tools provide robust implementations of FHE schemes that are crucial for developers looking to integrate privacy-preserving computations into their applications.

## Main Considerations for Fully Homomorphic Encryption

### 1. **Security and Privacy**

FHE guarantees that data remains encrypted throughout the entire computation process, ensuring that no sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized entities. This is particularly useful in scenarios where data processing must occur on untrusted platforms, such as cloud environments. The security of FHE relies on hard mathematical problems, such as the **Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE)** problem, which underpins the cryptographic hardness assumptions of most FHE schemes.

#### **Mathematical Foundations:**

- **Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE):** The RLWE problem is a lattice-based cryptographic assumption that is considered difficult to solve, even with quantum computers. FHE schemes based on RLWE provide strong security guarantees by leveraging the hardness of lattice problems, which remain secure against quantum attacks.
  
  The core idea is to encode the plaintext message into a polynomial form and then add "noise" to it. The noise is carefully managed to allow for meaningful computations while preventing decryption without the correct private key.

### 2. **Performance Overheads**

Despite its strong security guarantees, FHE comes with significant computational overheads. The primary challenge with FHE is its inefficiency compared to traditional cryptographic operations. This inefficiency arises due to the complex arithmetic operations performed on ciphertexts and the need to manage noise growth during computation.

#### **Optimization Techniques:**

- **Bootstrapping:** Bootstrapping is a technique used to refresh ciphertexts by reducing the accumulated noise, enabling further homomorphic operations. Although computationally expensive, bootstrapping is essential for supporting an unlimited number of operations on ciphertexts in FHE.
  
- **Batching:** This technique allows multiple data elements to be packed into a single ciphertext, enabling parallel computations and significantly improving throughput. Batching is particularly useful for vectorized operations common in machine learning and data analysis applications.
  
- **Key Switching:** Key switching is a method to transform ciphertexts encrypted under one key to be decrypted under another key. This is crucial in scenarios involving multiple parties with different encryption keys, such as collaborative computation.

### 3. **Implementation Complexity**

Implementing FHE is non-trivial and requires a deep understanding of lattice-based cryptography and numerical methods. Developers need to carefully manage various cryptographic parameters, such as the plaintext modulus, noise budget, polynomial degree, and encryption keys, to ensure both security and computational efficiency.

#### **Key Generation Formula:**

The generation of public and private keys in FHE is defined as follows:

\[
(pk, sk) \leftarrow \text{Gen}(\lambda, n, q)
\]

Where:
- \( \lambda \) is the security parameter that defines the cryptographic strength.
- \( n \) is the degree of the polynomial modulus used in encryption.
- \( q \) is the ciphertext modulus, determining the size of ciphertexts and the noise budget.

## Detailed Breakdown of Technical Structure

The following example uses the Microsoft SEAL library to demonstrate a simple FHE implementation:

### **Code Example Using Microsoft SEAL:**

```cpp
#include "seal/seal.h"

using namespace seal;

int main() {
    // Set encryption parameters and scheme
    EncryptionParameters parms(scheme_type::BFV);
    size_t poly_modulus_degree = 8192; // Polynomial modulus degree
    parms.set_poly_modulus_degree(poly_modulus_degree);
    
    // Set coefficient modulus and plain modulus
    parms.set_coeff_modulus(CoeffModulus::BFVDefault(poly_modulus_degree));
    parms.set_plain_modulus(PlainModulus::Batching(poly_modulus_degree, 20));

    // Create a SEALContext for encryption operations
    SEALContext context(parms);

    // Key generation for public and private keys
    KeyGenerator keygen(context);
    PublicKey public_key = keygen.public_key();
    SecretKey secret_key = keygen.secret_key();

    // Encryptor and Decryptor for encryption and decryption operations
    Encryptor encryptor(context, public_key);
    Decryptor decryptor(context, secret_key);
    Evaluator evaluator(context);

    // Encode plaintext messages
    Plaintext plain1("6");
    Plaintext plain2("7");
    
    // Encrypt the plaintexts
    Ciphertext encrypted1, encrypted2;
    encryptor.encrypt(plain1, encrypted1);
    encryptor.encrypt(plain2, encrypted2);

    // Perform homomorphic addition on encrypted data
    Ciphertext encrypted_sum;
    evaluator.add(encrypted1, encrypted2, encrypted_sum);

    // Decrypt the result to obtain the sum
    Plaintext plain_result;
    decryptor.decrypt(encrypted_sum, plain_result);

    std::cout << "Decrypted sum: " << plain_result.to_string() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Code Components:**

1. **Setting Encryption Parameters:**
   - **Scheme Type:** The BFV scheme is selected, which is suitable for basic arithmetic operations on encrypted data.
   - **Polynomial Modulus Degree:** Determines the size of the underlying polynomial, impacting both security and performance. Higher degrees increase security but also computational costs.
   - **Coefficient Modulus and Plain Modulus:** These parameters define the size of the ciphertext modulus and the plaintext space, respectively. The choice of these parameters impacts noise growth during homomorphic operations and must be carefully balanced to prevent overflow.

2. **Key Generation and Encryption Context:**
   - **SEALContext:** Initializes the encryption context with the specified parameters, setting up the environment for all subsequent cryptographic operations.
   - **KeyGenerator:** Generates the public and secret keys used for encryption and decryption. These keys are critical to maintaining the security of the encrypted data.

3. **Homomorphic Operations:**
   - **Encryptor and Decryptor:** These objects handle encryption and decryption operations. The encryptor uses the public key to encrypt plaintext messages, while the decryptor uses the secret key to decrypt the ciphertexts back into plaintext.
   - **Evaluator:** The core component for performing arithmetic operations on encrypted data. The example demonstrates a simple addition operation on two encrypted integers. More complex operations, such as multiplication or polynomial evaluation, can also be performed using the evaluator.

4. **Result Decryption:**
   - The encrypted result of the addition operation is decrypted to verify the correctness of the homomorphic computation. The output should match the result of the plaintext operation if the encryption scheme and parameters are set correctly.

### **Optimization and Extension**

- **Parameter Tuning:** Adjusting the parameters such as the polynomial modulus degree, plaintext modulus, and coefficient modulus to optimize performance and maintain security. This involves a trade-off between computation speed and the noise budget available for operations.
- **Advanced Homomorphic Operations:** Implement more complex FHE operations, such as matrix multiplication or neural network evaluation, using libraries like Microsoft SEAL or Googleâ€™s FHE Compiler for C++. These operations require careful management of noise growth and optimization techniques like bootstrapping.
- **Integration with Existing Systems:** Develop APIs or middleware to integrate FHE with existing data processing systems, enabling secure computations on sensitive data without exposing it to unauthorized parties.

## Conclusion

Fully Homomorphic Encryption represents a paradigm shift in data security by enabling computations on encrypted data without revealing the underlying plaintext. Although FHE is currently hindered by significant performance overheads and implementation complexity, ongoing research and development are focused on optimizing its efficiency and practicality for real-world applications. By leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques and optimization strategies, FHE has the potential to revolutionize secure data processing in untrusted environments, particularly in fields like cloud computing, healthcare, and finance.
