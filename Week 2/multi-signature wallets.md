# multi-signature wallet

Week 3 Report by Siyi Xu, Created on 01/09/2024

## Introduction

Multi-signature (or multi-sig) wallets are a type of digital wallet that require multiple private keys to authorize a transaction, rather than a single private key as is the case with standard wallets. This added layer of security makes multi-sig wallets an essential tool for organizations and individuals looking to secure their digital assets more robustly. This report explores the technical structure, advantages, and potential challenges of multi-signature wallets, offering a deep dive into their implementation and optimization.

## Main Problem and Focus

The fundamental problem that multi-signature wallets address is the single point of failure inherent in traditional single-signature wallets. In a standard wallet, a single private key grants access to the funds, making it susceptible to theft, loss, or misuse. If the private key is compromised, all the assets within the wallet can be stolen without any recourse.

Additionally, in organizational settings, the need for multiple stakeholders to authorize transactions poses a significant challenge when using single-signature wallets. There is no built-in mechanism to ensure that multiple parties agree to a transaction before it is executed, which can lead to misuse of funds or a lack of accountability.

## Technical Structure of Multi-signature wallet

## Conclusion

Multi-signature wallets represent a significant advancement in the security and management of digital assets on blockchain networks. By requiring multiple signatures to authorize transactions, they mitigate the risks associated with single points of failure and provide greater control and security, particularly in organizational settings.
